/**
 * Ported as-is from G2G's `hooks/use-competency-focus.ts`. No adaptation
 * needed — `useRouter`/`useSearchParams` from `next/navigation` behave the
 * same in this project. Shared by Certifications and Development & Career
 * Paths (Employee Profiles does not use it).
 *
 * The competency a screen was opened "for".
 *
 * The Competency Library's detail panel links out to Employee Profiles,
 * Development & Career and Certifications with `?competency_id=&competency=`.
 * Those screens read it here so the drill-through lands on a filtered list
 * instead of the full one, and can offer a one-click way back to everything.
 *
 * Returns nulls when the screen was opened normally, so callers can treat the
 * focus as an optional narrowing rather than a required parameter.
