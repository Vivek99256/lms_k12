/**
 * The chrome every Student → AI Stack screen shares.
 *
 * WHY THIS IS A RE-EXPORT AND NOT A SECOND COPY
 *
 * `app/fees/ai-stack/_screens/fees-ai-chrome.tsx` is pure presentation — a header strip,
 * a card, a pill, a table head, an `en-IN` date. It contains no fee logic, fetches
 * nothing, and knows about no tab. Copying two hundred lines of Tailwind so that the
 * student screens could have their own identical header is how modules end up looking
 * subtly different after a design tweak lands in one of them.
 *
 * So the Student screens import it, and this file is the seam that lets them do so
 * under names that read correctly on a student screen. Nothing in the Fees folder is
 * modified, nothing there imports from here, and a change to the shared chrome reaches
 * every module at once — which is the point. `app/attendance/ai-stack/_screens/
 * attendance-ai-chrome.ts` is the same seam for Attendance and made the same choice.
 *
 * The component is still in the Fees folder. When it moves out to a shared home, the four
 * seams like this one are what have to be repointed, and each is a one-line change.
