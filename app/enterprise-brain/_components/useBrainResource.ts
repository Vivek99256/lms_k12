 * Load-once-per-key fetch with an explicit refresh, shared by every Brain
 * screen so they report failure the same way.
 *
 * Errors are surfaced, never swallowed into an empty result: a screen showing
 * "no rows" when the request actually 404'd is the failure mode this whole
 * integration was brought in to remove.
 *
 * THE SELECTED ACADEMIC YEAR IS PART OF EVERY KEY. Brain payloads are read
 * once on mount, so without this a switch from 2022 to 2021 would leave the
 * 2022 figures on screen under a 2021 heading — the one failure mode worse than
 * an error, because it looks like an answer. Every screen goes through this
 * hook, so putting the year here covers all of them and none of them has to
 * remember to.
