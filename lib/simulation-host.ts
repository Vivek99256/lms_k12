/**
 * How this page talks to the Simulation Runtime that plays a simulation inside an iframe.
 *
 * The runtime is a separate, generic page (the `g2g-sim-runtime` build served from /sim-runtime/) that plays whatever `g2g.sim/1`
 * specification it is handed. It is embedded in a sandboxed frame WITHOUT `allow-same-origin`, so it runs on an opaque origin: it cannot read
 * this page's localStorage (where the login token lives), its cookies or its DOM, and it has no credentials of its own. The only thing that
 * crosses is a message, and each side checks it:
 *
 *   runtime -> host   { src: 'g2g-course', lesson, type: 'ready' }                                      listening, send me the specification
 *                     { src: 'g2g-course', lesson, type: 'spec', ok, issues[] }                          the verdict on a specification I was sent
 *                     { src: 'g2g-course', lesson, type: 'progress' | 'completed', step, percent, snapshot? }
 *                     { src: 'g2g-course', lesson, type: 'event', name, seq, payload, ts }               (not stored yet)
 *                     { src: 'g2g-course', lesson, type: 'assets-needed', models: [{ id, sha256 }] }    send me these 3D model files
 *   host -> runtime   { src: 'g2g-host', type: 'init', spec, resume? }                                   play this
 *                     { src: 'g2g-host', type: 'pause' | 'resume' }
 *                     { src: 'g2g-host', type: 'asset', sha256, bytes: ArrayBuffer, credit?, kind?, mime? }  one file (the buffer is transferred)
 *                     { src: 'g2g-host', type: 'asset-missing', sha256, reason? }                      a file that cannot be provided
 *
 * 3D MODELS AND IMAGES. They are private objects behind the API, which the frame (no login, opaque origin) can never call. A specification
 * names its files in `assets.models` ([{ id, sha256, name? }]); the runtime asks for them by hash, in requests of at most 8 and when it needs
 * them, and the host fetches ONLY a hash that the specification it holds names - never one the frame makes up - then hands the bytes over.
 * `kind` is 'model' or 'image' and `mime` the response's type when it is a known one. The runtime checks the SHA-256 of what it gets.
 * Downloads are limited to 3 at a time for the whole player (not per request), 25 MB for a model and 3 MB for an image.
 *
 * AUTHENTICATING A MESSAGE. A sandboxed frame's origin is "null", so the origin cannot tell one frame from another; the host therefore accepts
 * a message only when `event.source` is the very window of the iframe IT created, and only when it carries the lesson id it asked for. The
 * host's messages go to the frame with target origin "*" because an opaque origin cannot be named - safe here because the window is a reference
 * to our own frame and what is sent is the simulation specification the person is about to play and the model files it names, never a token. The runtime, in turn, is told
 * this page's origin (`from=`) and posts only to it.
