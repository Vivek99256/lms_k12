 * Turning a field, its context and an instruction into a prompt.
 *
 * Two things are load-bearing here.
 *
 * First, the model is told to return *only the replacement text*. This output is
 * dropped straight into a form field a teacher then saves, so a preamble like "Sure!
 * Here's a shorter version:" would be saved into a student's lesson plan. Stripping it
 * afterwards is guesswork; not producing it is reliable.
 *
 * Second, it is told not to invent facts. The single most damaging failure for school
 * content is a plausible fabrication — an exam date, a syllabus reference, a marks
 * total — because it looks exactly like the rest of the text and nobody re-checks a
 * field they only asked to be shortened.
